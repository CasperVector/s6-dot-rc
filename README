s6.rc: a distribution-friendly init/rc framework based on s6/s6-rc
==================================================================

About
-----

This is s6.rc [1], an init/rc framework based on s6/s6-rc [2].  s6.rc is an
attempt to bridge the gap between the elegant foundation provided by s6/s6-rc
and an init/rc system that implements the main functionalities beneficial for
distributions.  Like s6/s6-rc, s6.rc strives to be simple and flexible. s6.rc is
composed of a few parts:
* A clean, powerful and extensible preprocessor that generates source
  directories for use with s6-rc from given templates.
* Templates for longruns, oneshots and some convenient or necessary bundles,
  for use with the shipped preprocessor.
* Pre-written stage 1/2/3 scripts for use with s6, which are similar to those
  generated by s6-linux-init [2], but work with the rest of s6.rc.
* Configuration files and other auxillary files.

Usage
-----

s6.rc requires s6, s6-rc and the Byron Rakitzis implementation [3] of the rc(1)
shell; the user is expected to have a sufficient understanding of them (which
would be highly rewarding anyway).  s6.rc currently runs on Linux, and the
init/rc scripts might requires additional command line utilities to be present.
Note that although s6.rc requires Linux and rc(1), its design is independent
of them, and porting (if desirable) should not be too difficult.  cf. `Manual'
for more detailed documentation of s6.rc.
